## 1. Core Objective

To build the MLAS (Multi-Level Affiliate System) Suite, which exposes the full power of the underlying MLAS Capability (CB-1). This suite will provide the user interfaces, APIs, and administrative tools for Super Admins, Partners, and Clients to create, manage, and monitor their own complex, multi-level revenue-sharing and affiliate marketing ecosystems.

---

## 2. Key Features & Scope (In-Scope)

This suite will provide the following features, building upon the core MLAS capability:

| Feature | Description | Key Attributes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Model Configuration** | A UI for defining and managing revenue-sharing rules. | Supports Platform-First, Partner-Owned, Client-Owned, Zero-Platform-Cut, and Hybrid models. |
| **Multi-Level Attribution** | Tools for creating and visualizing complex, non-linear attribution trees. | Supports unlimited depth and branching. |
| **Commission & Payout Management** | Dashboards for tracking commissions, managing payouts, and handling disputes. | Integrated with the Financial Ledger Service (CS-1). |
| **Abuse Prevention & Fraud Detection** | A system for identifying and flagging suspicious activity. | Configurable rules and alerts. |
| **Flexible Pricing & Tiers** | Allows for different commission rates and pricing tiers for different actors. | Aligned with INV-001: Pricing Flexibility. |
| **Cross-Suite Integration** | The suite will be able to consume events from any other suite (e.g., Commerce, Transportation). | Event-driven and extensible. |

### 2.1. Distinction Between Capability and Suite

*   **CB-1: MLAS Capability:** The core, headless engine that provides the fundamental building blocks for revenue sharing (attribution, calculation, etc.). It has no UI.
*   **SC-2: MLAS Suite:** The user-facing application that consumes the MLAS Capability. It provides the dashboards, UIs, and workflows for managing the system.

## 3. Architectural Principles & Alignment

This suite must adhere to all 10 platform invariants.

| Invariant | Implementation in MLAS Suite |
| :--- | :--- |
| **INV-001: Pricing Flexibility** | The suite will allow for granular control over commission rates and pricing for every actor in the system. |
| **INV-006: MLAS as Infrastructure** | The suite is the primary interface to the MLAS infrastructure, providing the tools for configuration without dictating policy. |
| **INV-007: Data Residency** | All data generated by the MLAS suite will be subject to the platform's data residency policies. |
| **Offline-First** | While management functions are primarily online, the underlying MLAS capability can process transactions that occurred offline. |

## 4. Dependencies

*   **CB-1: MLAS Capability:** This is the foundational dependency. The suite cannot function without it.
