## 1. Foundational Principle

**Social graphs and content management are core platform primitives**, essential for building community platforms, social networks, and educational suites. The platform MUST provide a flexible, scalable, and extensible foundation for managing users, relationships, and content.

---

## 2. Mandatory Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Unified User Identity
- **Single Source of Truth:** A single, unified user identity system will be used across all social and content features.
- **Tenant-Scoped Profiles:** User profiles are tenant-scoped, allowing for different personas in different communities.

### 2.2 Extensible Social Graph
- **Relationship Primitives:** The platform will provide primitives for managing user relationships (e.g., `follow`, `friend`, `block`, `member`).
- **Graph Database (Optional):** A graph database (e.g., Amazon Neptune) may be used to store and query social graph data for performance at scale.

### 2.3 Composable Content Management
- **Content Primitives:** The platform will provide primitives for creating, reading, updating, and deleting content (e.g., posts, comments, articles, media).
- **Headless CMS:** Content management will be headless, with a clear separation between content and presentation.

### 2.4 AI-Powered Moderation and Safety
- **Proactive Filtering:** The AI Orchestration Layer will be used to proactively filter harmful, offensive, or illegal content.
- **User Reporting:** Users will be able to report content and users, triggering a moderation workflow.

---

## 3. Enforcement Expectations

- **CI Guardrails:** CI checks will be implemented to ensure that social and content features use the defined primitives.
- **Architecture Reviews:** All new features will be reviewed for their impact on the social graph and content models.
- **Privacy by Design:** All social and content features will be designed with privacy as a primary consideration.
