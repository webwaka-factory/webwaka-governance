**Status:** Ratified

## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) mandates that all user and application data stored offline (“at rest”) within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory must be encrypted. This is a non-negotiable requirement to protect the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Scope

*   **In-Scope:** All offline data, including but not limited to database records, cached files, and user-generated content.
*   **Out-of-Scope:** Logs are excluded from this encryption requirement.

### 2.2. Encryption Requirements

*   **Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM must be used for all at-rest encryption.
*   **Transparency:** Encryption and decryption must be transparent to the application logic.

### 2.3. Key Management

*   **Device-Bound Keys:** Encryption keys must be bound to the device and, where possible, to the application.
*   **No Key Reuse:** Keys must not be reused across devices.
*   **Recovery:** An optional key backup and recovery mechanism may be provided, but it must be user-controlled.

### 2.4. Verification

*   **Automated Tests:** Automated tests must be implemented to verify that data is being correctly encrypted and decrypted.
*   **Failure:** Any failure in the encryption or decryption process must result in a hard stop of the application.

## 3. Enforcement

Compliance with this FD is enforced through a combination of automated tests and mandatory peer reviews for all code that handles data storage. Any deviation from this mandate requires a formal exception approved by the Founder.
