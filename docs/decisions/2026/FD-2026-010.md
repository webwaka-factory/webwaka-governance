# FD-2026-010: Platform Crypto Only

**Status:** Ratified
**Ratified:** 2026-02-02

---

## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) mandates the exclusive use of approved, platform-native cryptographic libraries within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory. The implementation of custom or non-standard cryptographic algorithms is strictly prohibited to minimize security risks and ensure a high standard of cryptographic hygiene.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Approved Cryptographic Libraries

The following libraries are approved for use:

| Platform | Library/API         | Notes                                                                 |
| :------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web      | WebCrypto           | The standard browser API for cryptographic operations.                |
| Mobile   | libsodium           | A modern and easy-to-use cryptographic library.                       |
| Mobile   | OS Keystores        | Platform-native keystores for secure key storage (e.g., iOS Keychain, Android Keystore). |

### 2.2. Prohibited Practices

The following practices are strictly prohibited:

*   **Custom Crypto:** The implementation of custom cryptographic algorithms.
*   **Hardcoded Keys:** The hardcoding of cryptographic keys in any form.
*   **Weak Algorithms:** The use of weak or deprecated cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, DES).

### 2.3. Cryptographic Standards

The following cryptographic standards must be adhered to:

*   **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305
*   **Key Derivation:** Argon2id or PBKDF2

### 2.4. Key Management

*   **Generation:** Keys must be generated on the device.
*   **Storage:** Keys must be stored in a secure enclave or the platform's native keystore.
*   **Rotation:** Keys must be rotated annually.
*   **Escrow:** Key escrow is not permitted by default.

## 3. Enforcement

Compliance with this FD is enforced through a combination of static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI pipeline and mandatory peer reviews for all cryptographic code. Any violation will block the merging of a pull request.
