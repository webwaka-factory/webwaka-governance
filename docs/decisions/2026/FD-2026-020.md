## 1. Foundational Principle

**Trust is non-negotiable.** The platform MUST be designed and operated in compliance with global and industry-specific regulations to protect user data, ensure privacy, and build trust with partners and clients. Compliance is a core platform capability, not an afterthought.

## 2. Mandatory Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Compliance-as-Code
- **Automated Guardrails:** Compliance policies will be codified and enforced through automated CI/CD guardrails.
- **Immutable Audit Logs:** All sensitive actions and data access will be recorded in an immutable audit log.

### 2.2 Pluggable Compliance Modules
- **Jurisdiction-Specific Policies:** The platform will support pluggable compliance modules for different jurisdictions (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, NDPR).
- **Industry-Specific Policies:** The platform will support pluggable compliance modules for different industries (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

### 2.3 Data Residency and Sovereignty
- **Configurable Data Residency:** Partners will be able to configure the geographic region where their data is stored.
- **Data Sovereignty Controls:** The platform will provide tools to ensure that data does not leave its designated region.

### 2.4 Privacy by Design
- **Data Minimization:** The platform will only collect and store data that is necessary for its operation.
- **User Consent:** Users will have granular control over their data and must provide explicit consent for its use.

---

## 3. Enforcement Expectations

- **CI Guardrails:** CI checks will enforce compliance policies and best practices.
- **Architecture Reviews:** All new features will be reviewed for their impact on compliance and data privacy.
- **Regular Audits:** The platform will undergo regular internal and external security and compliance audits.
