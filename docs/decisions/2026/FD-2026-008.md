# FD-2026-008: Decisions Are Immutable Once Approved

**Status:** Ratified
**Ratified:** 2026-02-02
**Replaces:** None

---

## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) establishes the principle of immutability for all ratified Founder Decisions. Once a decision is approved and merged into the `main` branch of the `webwaka-governance` repository, it is considered immutable and cannot be altered. This ensures a stable, predictable, and auditable governance framework.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Immutability Rules

*   **No Edits:** Approved decisions cannot be edited or modified in any way.
*   **Supersession Only:** The only mechanism for changing a decision is to supersede it with a new Founder Decision.

### 2.2. Historical Record

*   **Git as Authority:** The Git history of the `webwaka-governance` repository is the authoritative historical record of all decisions.
*   **No Rewrites:** Force pushing or any other form of history rewriting on the `main` branch is strictly prohibited.

### 2.3. Supersession Process

*   **New FD Required:** To supersede an existing decision, a new Founder Decision must be created.
*   **Reference:** The new decision must explicitly reference the FD it is superseding.
*   **Notice:** The new decision must include a clear "Supersession Notice" section that explains the change.

## 3. Enforcement

This FD is enforced through branch protection rules in GitHub, which prevent direct pushes and history rewrites to the `main` branch. All changes must be made through pull requests, which are subject to mandatory peer review and CI checks.
