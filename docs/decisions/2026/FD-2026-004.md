## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) establishes the authoritative multi-repository topology for the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory. This structure is designed to enforce a clear separation of concerns, streamline dependency management, and enable independent development and release cycles.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Repository Purposes

Each repository in the WebWaka ecosystem has a specific and narrowly defined purpose.

| Repository                     | Purpose                                                               |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `webwaka-governance`           | Decisions, invariants, and governance CI.                             |
| `webwaka-platform-foundation`  | Core platform primitives and foundational libraries.                  |
| `webwaka-core-services`        | Authentication, IAM, and core APIs.                                   |
| `webwaka-capabilities`         | Discrete feature capabilities (e.g., offline-first, search).          |
| `webwaka-suites`               | User-facing product groupings and applications.                       |
| `webwaka-infrastructure`       | CI/CD pipelines, observability configurations, and infrastructure-as-code. |

### 2.2. Dependencies

Dependencies between repositories are strictly enforced to maintain a clear architectural hierarchy.

*   **Unidirectional Flow:** The primary dependency flow is unidirectional: `webwaka-governance` → `webwaka-platform-foundation` → `webwaka-core-services` → `webwaka-capabilities` → `webwaka-suites`.
*   **Governance Authority:** The `webwaka-governance` repository is the root of the dependency tree and is a dependency for all other repositories.
*   **Infrastructure Isolation:** The `webwaka-infrastructure` repository supports all other repositories but does not have any functional dependencies on them.

### 2.3. Shared Code

Code sharing between repositories is managed through a formal versioning and packaging process.

*   **Packaged Libraries:** Shared code must be distributed as versioned packages through a private package registry.
*   **No Direct Imports:** Direct cross-repository imports or sub-module dependencies are strictly prohibited.

### 2.4. Release Coordination

Each repository follows an independent release and versioning strategy.

*   **Independent Versioning:** Each repository is versioned independently using semantic versioning (SemVer).
*   **Compatibility Matrix:** A compatibility matrix is maintained in the `webwaka-governance` repository to define compatible versions between repositories.
*   **No Lockstep Releases:** Lockstep or coordinated releases across multiple repositories are discouraged.

## 3. Enforcement

Adherence to this multi-repository topology is enforced through CI checks that validate dependency graphs and import statements. Any proposed changes to the repository structure or dependency rules must be approved by the Founder via a formal FD amendment.
