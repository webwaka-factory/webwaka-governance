## 1. Foundational Principle

**Marketplace mechanics are core platform primitives**, essential for building transportation platforms, real estate portals, freelance marketplaces, and other multi-sided platforms. The platform MUST provide a robust, scalable, and extensible foundation for managing listings, bidding, matching, and transactions.

## 2. Mandatory Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Generic Marketplace Domain
- **Abstract Primitives:** The platform will provide a generic marketplace domain with abstract primitives (e.g., `Listing`, `Offer`, `Bid`, `Transaction`).
- **Industry-Specific Extensions:** Industry-specific logic will be built on top of these generic primitives, not as separate systems.

### 2.2 Event-Driven Marketplace Engine
- **Real-Time Updates:** The marketplace engine will be event-driven, using the real-time systems infrastructure to provide live updates on listings, bids, and offers.
- **Matching Algorithms:** Matching algorithms will be pluggable, allowing for different matching strategies (e.g., price, proximity, reputation).

### 2.3 Multi-Sided Transaction Support
- **Split Payments:** The billing and payments domain will support split payments, allowing for commissions, fees, and multi-party payouts.
- **Escrow and Dispute Resolution:** The platform will provide mechanisms for holding funds in escrow and resolving disputes between buyers and sellers.

### 2.4 Reputation and Trust System
- **Ratings and Reviews:** The platform will provide a system for buyers and sellers to rate and review each other.
- **Trust Score:** A trust score will be calculated for each user based on their transaction history, ratings, and other signals.

## 3. Enforcement Expectations

- **CI Guardrails:** CI checks will be implemented to ensure that marketplace features use the defined primitives.
- **Architecture Reviews:** All new features will be reviewed for their impact on the marketplace domain.
- **Fairness and Transparency:** All marketplace algorithms will be designed to be fair and transparent.
