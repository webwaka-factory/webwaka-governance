## 1. Foundational Principle

**Geolocation is a core platform primitive**, essential for building transportation platforms, local services, and delivery applications. The platform MUST provide a robust, scalable, and extensible foundation for managing location data, proximity search, and routing.

## 2. Mandatory Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Standardized Geolocation Data Model
- **Data Format:** All geolocation data will be stored in a standardized format (e.g., GeoJSON).
- **Database Support:** The database will be configured to support efficient spatial queries (e.g., using PostGIS or native geolocation data types).

### 2.2 Geolocation Service Abstraction
- **Service Layer:** A dedicated geolocation service layer will abstract the underlying mapping and routing providers (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap).
- **Provider Agnostic:** The platform will be provider-agnostic, allowing for different providers to be used in different regions or for different use cases.

### 2.3 Real-Time Location Tracking
- **Integration with Real-Time Systems:** The geolocation service will integrate with the real-time systems infrastructure to provide live location tracking.
- **Offline Support:** The platform will support offline location tracking, queuing location updates and syncing them when connectivity is restored.

### 2.4 Geofencing and Proximity Alerts
- **Geofencing API:** The platform will provide an API for creating and managing geofences.
- **Event-Driven Alerts:** The platform will emit events when users enter or exit geofences, or when they come within a certain proximity of each other.

---

## 3. Enforcement Expectations

- **CI Guardrails:** CI checks will be implemented to ensure that geolocation features use the defined service layer.
- **Architecture Reviews:** All new features will be reviewed for their impact on the geolocation data model and services.
- **Data Privacy:** All geolocation data will be treated as sensitive personal information and protected accordingly.
