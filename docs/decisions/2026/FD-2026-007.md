## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) establishes that the Founder is the sole and ultimate decision-making authority within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory. This centralized authority model is designed to ensure strategic alignment, maintain a coherent vision, and provide a clear and unambiguous source of truth for all governance and technical matters.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Decisions Requiring Founder Approval

The following categories of decisions require explicit approval from the Founder:

*   **Scope Changes:** Any change that alters the scope of a project, initiative, or task.
*   **Architecture:** Any decision related to the fundamental architecture of the system.
*   **Security Posture:** Any change that affects the security posture of the system.
*   **Invariant Changes:** Any change to a ratified Founder Decision.

### 2.2. Decision Process

All requests for a Founder decision must follow a formal and transparent process.

*   **Request Format:** Decision requests must be submitted as a GitHub Issue using the "Decision Request" template.
*   **Evidence:** All decision requests must be accompanied by sufficient evidence to support the request.
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** The default SLA for a decision is **72 hours** from the time of submission.

### 2.3. Documentation

All Founder Decisions must be documented in a consistent and accessible format.

*   **Naming Convention:** Decisions are to be named using the format `FD-YYYY-###` (e.g., FD-2026-007).
*   **Format:** Decisions must be documented in Markdown format and stored in the `webwaka-governance` repository.
*   **Registry:** All decisions must be recorded in an indexed registry for easy reference.

### 2.4. Enforcement

Compliance with Founder Decisions is enforced through automated checks and manual reviews.

*   **CI Checks:** CI pipelines will include invariant checks to ensure that all code and configurations comply with ratified decisions.
*   **Merge Blocking:** Any violation of a Founder Decision will block the merging of a pull request.

## 3. Enforcement

This FD is enforced through the governance model itself. Any attempt to bypass the Founder's authority is a direct violation of the core principles of the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory and will result in immediate corrective action.
