## 1. Foundational Principle

**Real-time systems are a first-class platform capability**, essential for supporting social networks, transportation marketplaces, live collaboration, and instant notifications. The platform MUST provide robust, scalable, and extensible real-time infrastructure.

---

## 2. Mandatory Architectural Principles

### 2.1 WebSocket-First Communication
- **Primary Mechanism:** WebSockets are the primary mechanism for real-time client-server communication.
- **Fallback:** HTTP long-polling may be used as a fallback for environments where WebSockets are not supported.

### 2.2 Event-Driven Real-Time Triggers
- **Source of Truth:** The platform's event bus (AWS EventBridge) is the source of truth for real-time updates.
- **Integration:** The real-time layer MUST subscribe to events and push updates to clients via WebSockets.

### 2.3 Scalable Connection Management
- **Infrastructure:** Use a scalable WebSocket management service (e.g., AWS API Gateway WebSockets, AWS IoT Core) to handle millions of concurrent connections.
- **Statelessness:** The real-time layer MUST be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling.

### 2.4 Channel-Based Subscriptions
- **Granularity:** Clients subscribe to specific channels (e.g., `tenant:uuid`, `order:uuid`, `user:uuid`) to receive relevant updates.
- **Authorization:** Subscription requests MUST be authorized to ensure clients only receive data they have permission to access.

---

## 3. Enforcement Expectations

- **CI Guardrails:** CI checks will be implemented to ensure that features requiring real-time updates utilize the WebSocket infrastructure.
- **Architecture Reviews:** All new features will be reviewed for real-time implications and adherence to this strategy.
- **Performance Testing:** The real-time layer will be subject to rigorous performance testing to ensure it meets the platform's max-scale requirements.
