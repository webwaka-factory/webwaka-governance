## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) establishes a strict prohibition on the hardcoding of secrets within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory. Secrets must be managed through approved, secure mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and to facilitate secure and auditable operational practices.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Definition of a Secret

A “secret” is defined as any piece of information that grants access to a protected resource. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   API keys
*   Authentication tokens
*   Passwords and other credentials
*   Certificates and private keys

### 2.2. Prohibited Practices

The hardcoding of secrets in any of the following locations is strictly prohibited:

*   Source code
*   Comments
*   Configuration files
*   Test data

### 2.3. Secret Management

*   **Approved Mechanisms:** Secrets must be managed through environment variables or a dedicated secret management service (e.g., GitHub Secrets).
*   **Rotation:** All secrets must be rotated at least quarterly.

### 2.4. Detection and Enforcement

*   **Secret Scanning:** Automated secret scanning will be integrated into the CI pipeline.
*   **Merge Blocking:** The detection of a hardcoded secret will block the merging of a pull request.
*   **Overrides:** Only the Founder has the authority to override a secret scanning violation.

## 3. Enforcement

This FD is enforced through a combination of automated secret scanning in the CI pipeline and mandatory peer reviews. Any violation will result in a failed build and will require immediate remediation.
