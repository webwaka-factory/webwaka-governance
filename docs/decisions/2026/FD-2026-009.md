## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) mandates that Continuous Integration (CI) enforcement is non-negotiable for all repositories within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory. All code changes must pass a series of automated checks before they can be merged, ensuring a consistent standard of quality, security, and compliance.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. CI Requirements

*   **Required Checks:** The following checks must be run in CI for all pull requests:
    *   Linting
    *   Unit tests
    *   Integration tests
    *   Security scan
*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** 100% of required checks must pass for a pull request to be considered eligible for merging.
*   **Bypass:** Only the Founder has the authority to bypass CI checks.

### 2.2. Test Requirements

*   **Minimum Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** test coverage is required for all new or modified code.
*   **Mandatory Tests:** Unit and integration tests are mandatory for all functional code.

### 2.3. Enforcement

*   **Branch Protection:** CI enforcement is implemented through branch protection rules in GitHub.
*   **No Force Merges:** Force merges are strictly prohibited.
*   **Merge Blocking:** A failing CI build will block the merging of a pull request.

## 3. Enforcement

This FD is enforced through the configuration of the CI/CD system and the branch protection rules in GitHub. Any attempt to circumvent these controls is a direct violation of this decision and will be subject to immediate review.
