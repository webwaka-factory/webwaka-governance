## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) establishes GitHub as the sole and authoritative system of record for all technical and governance artifacts within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory. All work, decisions, and context must be durably recorded in GitHub to ensure transparency, traceability, and a single source of truth.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Information Domicile

The following artifacts **must** reside within the WebWaka GitHub organization:

*   **Code:** All source code for all repositories.
*   **Decisions:** All Founder Decisions and related governance documents.
*   **Specifications:** All technical and functional specifications.
*   **Tests:** All unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **CI Results:** All logs and artifacts generated by CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Documentation:** All technical and user-facing documentation.
*   **Issues:** All work items, bug reports, and decision requests.
*   **Pull Requests:** All code changes and associated reviews.

The following information **must not** be stored in GitHub:

*   Secrets, credentials, or private keys.
*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

### 2.2. Artifact Usage

Specific GitHub features are to be used for designated purposes:

| Artifact          | Purpose                               |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Issues**        | Tracking work and decisions.          |
| **Pull Requests** | Managing implementation and code review. |
| **Markdown Docs** | Documenting specifications and governance. |
| **Discussions**   | Deprecated in favor of Issues.        |

### 2.3. Information Lifecycle

All information within GitHub is subject to the following lifecycle rules:

*   **Retention:** All artifacts must be retained indefinitely.
*   **Archival:** Archival of information is to be accomplished only through GitHub's native repository archival feature.

## 3. Enforcement

Compliance with this FD is enforced through a combination of CI checks (e.g., secret scanning) and mandatory peer reviews. Any proposal to use an external system of record requires a formal exception approved by the Founder.
