## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) establishes a formal role-based execution model for all agents operating within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory. This model ensures clear lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability for all automated and human-in-the-loop actions.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Canonical Roles

The following are the canonical agent roles within the WebWaka ecosystem:

| Role                | Responsibilities                                                              |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Founder**         | Sole decision-making authority.                                               |
| **Chief of Staff**  | Coordination, planning, and orchestration of agent activities.                |
| **Execution Agent** | Implementation of technical tasks and code changes.                           |
| **QA Agent**        | Quality assurance, testing, and validation of agent work.                     |
| **Security Agent**  | Security analysis, vulnerability scanning, and compliance monitoring.         |
| **Documentation Agent** | Creation and maintenance of technical and user-facing documentation.          |

### 2.2. Role Assignment

Role assignment is a dynamic and task-specific process.

*   **Flexibility:** Any Manus account may assume any of the defined roles.
*   **Declaration:** The role for a given task is explicitly declared in the initial prompt for that task.
*   **Exclusivity:** An agent may have multiple roles across different tasks, but only one role per task.

### 2.3. Authority Levels

Authority is strictly delineated by role.

*   **Founder:** Absolute authority over all decisions.
*   **Chief of Staff:** Authority is limited to coordination and planning. No authority to make technical or governance decisions.
*   **Other Agents:** Authority is strictly limited to the execution of tasks within their defined scope.

### 2.4. Accountability

Accountability is ensured through comprehensive traceability and performance monitoring.

*   **Traceability:** All agent actions must be traceable to a specific GitHub artifact (e.g., an issue or pull request).
*   **Metrics:** Performance metrics will be tracked for each role.
*   **Failure:** Silent failure (i.e., failure to complete a task without reporting an error) is considered a violation of this FD.

## 3. Enforcement

Adherence to this role-based execution model is enforced through prompt validation and CI checks. Any deviation from the defined roles or authorities requires a formal exception approved by the Founder.
