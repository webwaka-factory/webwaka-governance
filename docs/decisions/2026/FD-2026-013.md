## 1. Mandate

This Founder Decision (FD) mandates that all context related to work, decisions, and technical implementation within the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory must reside in GitHub. This ensures that all information is discoverable, traceable, and accessible to all agents and stakeholders, creating a single, authoritative source of truth.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Required Context

The following context must be documented in GitHub:

*   **Decisions:** All Founder Decisions and the rationale behind them.
*   **Requirements:** All functional and non-functional requirements.
*   **Designs:** All architectural and technical design documents.

### 2.2. Context Format

*   **Format:** All context must be documented in Markdown format.
*   **Structure:** Documents must use structured headers to ensure readability and consistency.
*   **Linking:** All context must be linked to the relevant issues and pull requests.

### 2.3. Accessibility

*   **Registry:** All context must be indexed in a central registry for easy discovery.
*   **Cross-Links:** Cross-linking between related documents, issues, and pull requests is mandatory.

### 2.4. Context Lifecycle

*   **Retention:** All context must be retained permanently.
*   **Archival:** Archival is to be accomplished only through GitHub's native repository archival feature.

## 3. Enforcement

Compliance with this FD is enforced through mandatory peer reviews and CI checks that validate the presence and format of required documentation. Any work that is not accompanied by the required context will be rejected.
