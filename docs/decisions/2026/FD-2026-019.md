## 1. Foundational Principle

**Partner-led extensibility is a core strategic advantage.** The platform MUST provide a Software Development Kit (SDK) and a marketplace to enable partners to build, publish, and monetize their own modules, fostering a vibrant ecosystem and accelerating platform growth.

## 2. Mandatory Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Comprehensive Module SDK
- **Development Environment:** The SDK will provide a sandboxed development environment, tools, and documentation for building modules.
- **Access to Primitives:** The SDK will provide secure and versioned access to all platform primitives (Events, AI, Billing, etc.).

### 2.2 Secure by Design
- **Sandboxing:** Modules will run in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions.
- **Capability-Based Security:** Modules will declare the capabilities they require, and users will grant consent upon installation.

### 2.3 Rigorous Governance and Approval Workflow
- **Automated Scans:** All submitted modules will undergo automated security, performance, and code quality scans.
- **Manual Review:** A manual review process will ensure that modules meet platform standards for user experience, documentation, and value.

### 2.4 Partner-Centric Marketplace
- **Discovery and Distribution:** The marketplace will provide a central location for partners to discover and install modules.
- **Monetization and Billing:** The platform will handle billing and payouts for paid modules, taking a commission on each sale.

## 3. Enforcement Expectations

- **CI Guardrails:** CI checks will enforce SDK usage and security best practices for module development.
- **Architecture Reviews:** The Module SDK and marketplace infrastructure will be subject to rigorous architectural review.
- **Legal and Commercial Framework:** A clear legal and commercial framework will govern the partner marketplace.
